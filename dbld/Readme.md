This schema represents a system where users can create tasks, and tasks can be categorized into multiple categories. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Tables and Their Purpose
   users Table
   This table is used to store information regarding the users of the system.

Column Name	DataType	Constraints	Description
id	 integer	Primary Key	Unique identifier for every user.
username	varchar	Unique	The name of the username the user creates. Should be unique across all users.
email	varchar	Unique	The email address of the user. Must be unique across all users.
password_hash	varchar	None	Stores the hashed password for secure authentication.
created_at	timestamp	None	Records the timestamp when the user account was created.
Purpose: This table manages user accounts and their credentials.

tasks Table
This table stores information about tasks created by users.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id.integer	Primary Key	Unique identifier for each task.
user_id.integer	Foreign Key (references users.id)	Identifies the user who created the task.
title	varchar	None	The title or name of the task.
description(text)No	Long description of the task.
due_date(timestamp)No	Due date of the task.
is_completed(boolean)No	Whether the task is completed or not.
created_at(timestamp)NoRecords the timestamp when the task was created.
updated_at(timestamp)NoRecords the timestamp when the task was last updated.
Purpose - This table manages tasks created by users, including their details and status.

categories Table
This table contains information about categories that tasks can be assigned to.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id(int)	Primary Key	Unique identifier for each category.
name	varchar	Unique	The name of the category. Must be unique across all categories.
color	varchar	None	A color associated with the category (e.g., for UI purposes).
Purpose: This table manages categories that can be assigned to tasks.

task_categories Table
This is a junction table (also called an association table) that establishes a many-to-many relationship between tasks and categories.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
task_id	integer	Foreign Key (references tasks.id)	Identifies the task.
category_id	integer	Foreign Key (references categories.id)	Identifies the category.
Indexes:

A composite unique index on the columns task_id, category_id guarantees that the task-category tuples will be unique. This ensures that duplicate assignment of one category to a task is never made.

It associates tasks to categories. That means one task can be grouped into many different categories while a category will be able to contain many different tasks.

2. Relationships Among Tables
   One-to-Many Relationship
   users and tasks:

One user creates many tasks.

That would be represented via the user_id foreign key in the tasks table, which references the column id in the users table.
