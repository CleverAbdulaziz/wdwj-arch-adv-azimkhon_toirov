Program for task management that lets users add, mark, and remove tasks as completed. The implementation is broken down as follows:

1. Index.html (HTML):

1. Establishes the application's fundamental framework, including a task list, input field, add button, and header.



2. Styles.css (CSS):

1. Styles the application to make it responsive and aesthetically pleasing.
2. Makes use of a simple, minimalistic layout with delicate shadows and a white backdrop.
3. To improve user feedback, buttons are given hover effects.


3. Script.js, or JavaScript:

1. Manages the ability to add tasks, mark them as finished, and remove them.
2. Responds to user actions (such as clicking the "add" button, hitting "Enter," checking or unchecking tasks, and removing tasks) by using event listeners.
   The fundamental situation of adding tasks and marking them as completed is covered by this solution. By enabling users to remove tasks, it also addresses the advanced case to some extent.

You would need to include elements like these in order to completely implement the advanced scenario:

Task categorization, such as including a dropdown menu for categories when a task is created
Establishing deadlines (for example, by include a date picker in the task creation process)
Tasks can be filtered by category, status, or due date by adding filter buttons or a search bar.


Additional HTML elements, CSS styles, and JavaScript capabilities would be needed for these sophisticated features.
